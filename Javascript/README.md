## Running the solutions
The javascript scripts can be run from the main.js file. You will need nodejs to run these files and you can run them with the command
```
node main.js
```

#### Running Tests
You will need to have mochajs installed. With npm installed, you can do this with the following command.
```
npm install -g mocha
```

From there, you can run all tests with the command
```
mocha **/test.js
```

If you are with a directory with a test file, you can simply run the `mocha` command to run tests from just that module.
