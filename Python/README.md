Python Solutions
================
HackerRank solutions in Python 3.

## Running the solutions
You can run the python code in either python 2 or 3 for most projects, though python 3 support has priority. You can run a package by invoking python on a directory that contains a \_\_main\_\_.py file. For example,
```
python python_song_of_pi/
```

#### Running Tests
You will need to install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file. This includes pytest and pytest-sugar. With those installed, you can run all tests in all subdirecties with the command
```
py.test
```
