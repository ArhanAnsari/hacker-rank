C++ Solutions
=============
HackerRank solutions in C++.


## Running the solutions
You can run the C++ code by using the CMake build system. A CMakeLists.txt file is supplied for each solution and a vew top level CMakeLists.txt files that allow you to build all of the C++ solutions from the C++ subdirectory.

#### Compiling the Solutions
You must have a C++ compiler and CMake set up on your system. Then run the following commands from the C++ subdirectory.
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
You might need to use a different toolchain depending on which compiler you are using and which operating system you are on.
