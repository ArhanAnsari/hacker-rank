# Input and Output

## Problem Statement

For any program that we write the basic things that we need to do is take the input and print the expected output.

In C++ you can take the input using cin and print the output using cout.Unlike C where you need the format specifier in printf and scanf, here you can use cin and cout.

Taking Input:
```
If you want to input a number: cin>>n ,  where n is the number.
If you want to input a number and a string: cin>>n>>s, where s is the string.
```
Printing output:
```
If you want to output a single number: cout<<n
If you want to output a number and a string separated by a new line: cout<<n<<endl<<s (where endl moves the pinter to the new line and then string gets printed.)
```
Take three numbers as inputs and print the sum of the three numbers.

## Input Format

The first line of the input contains three integers A,B and C.
```
1≤A,B,C≤1000
```
## Output Format

In a single line print the sum of the three numbers.

## Sample Input
```
1 2 7
```
## Sample Output
```
10
```
## Explanation

Sum of the three numbers 1,2 and 7 is 10.
