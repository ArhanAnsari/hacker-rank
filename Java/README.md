Java Solutions
==============
HackerRank solutions in Java.

## Running the solutions
You will need a Java compiler and Gradle installed on your system. You can navigate to a directory containing a build.gradle file and run the code with the `gradle run` command. Note that you can use quiet mode with gradle to remove the gradle stdout output. To do this add the `-q` flag. Ex: `gradle -q run`.

#### Running the Tests
Some of the Java solutions have tests written for them. You can run these tests with either the commands `gradle test` or `gradle build`. If the tests fail, you will see output telling you which tests failed. If no tests failed, there will be no output.
